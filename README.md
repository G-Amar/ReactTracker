# Tracker Application

This is an SPA created with React, JSON server, and React-router-dom

Through developing this React project, I gained valuable experience in: 
 - creating and using functional components, 
 - managing React state (dealing with state hooks and props), 
 - and making requests to access and modify data a JSON server (asynchronously). 

These skills will be helpful for building more complex applications in the future.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

This will startup the JSON server on localhost:5000. Go to http://localhost:5000/tasks to see the data for each of the tasks.
